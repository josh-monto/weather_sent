This project was created to analyze local sentiment about weather in selected cities,
using both the Twitter API and National Weather Service API. This project can be run using
the Flask framework.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To access the Twitter API, a file named 'bearer_token.txt' must be added to the root
project folder and must contain only a bearer token from Twitter, which can be easily generated on
developer.twitter.com. This application is not a heavy user of data, but be aware of rate limits regardless.
